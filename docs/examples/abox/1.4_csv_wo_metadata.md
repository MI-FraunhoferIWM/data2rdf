# ABox generation from a csv file without metadata

## General understanding

In this example, we are looking into sensor data which is provided by a csv file. However, we do not have any metadata in this case, but directly start with the time series. Additionaly, each column in this time series is of the same ontological class, but was recorded by a different sensor.

### The input data

For this example, we will consider the following inputs:

* the csv file produced by the sensors
* the mapping for describing the data in RDF
* the parser arguments telling the pipeline that we do not have any metadata in the file.
